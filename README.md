# Introducing-Generative-AI-with-AWS
Capstone Project: Introducing Generative AI with AWS

In this final project for the "Introducing Generative AI with AWS" course on Udacity, I'm diving into the world of AWS Sagemaker and Python programming. My goal is to fine-tune the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model on AWS sagemaker and see how well it handles real-world tasks.

I'm using a financial dataset .
